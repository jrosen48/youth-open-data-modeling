# youth-open-data-modeling

This repository is for the beginning stafes of a project that aims to involve youth in modeling open data, particularly data that is made available by the city of Knoxville. 

## Where is the open data?

- [Knoxville's in-development open data portal](http://www.knoxvilletn.gov/government/opendata)
- [Knoxville's Metropolitan Planning commission's open data portal](https://knoxmpc.org/opendata/)
- [KnoxData's GitHub repositories](https://github.com/knoxdata)

## This seems like things that adults would use, and even they wouldn't find it very interesting. Why open data?

- There are a number of reasons why youth ought to work with complex sources of data in general, like the way that working with data can empower youth to be able to ask and answer questions that matter to them; working with data is increasingly a part of many areas of study and occupations and it cuts across content areas
- Open data in particular may be a valuable data source because it can be relevant to youth; it's about the places and things they experience daily
- Another benefit of open data is that youth may generate new knowledge based on their vantage as students, athletes, and (young) citizens that they can share back to the community

## What will youth do, broadly?

One idea is for youth to engage in increasingly more abstract forms of information about the community:

- Explore part of Knoxville
- Explore a version of Knoxville as represented in a world like Minecraft (see [Minecraft Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/5)
- Engage in data modeling, perhaps using a tool such as [CODAP](https://codap.concord.org/)

## Okay, what will they specifically do? Who even are these youth?

In terms of the setting, there is a nascent data-Hackathon being arranged by the [KnoxDevs](https://knoxdevs.com/) (and the [KnoxData](https://www.meetup.com/knoxdata/) group in particular). 

- One idea is to work with youth before the Hackathon and to use the Hackathon to complete their work and share what they find with the developer and civic community at the Hackathon. 
- Another is to work in a K12 (perhaps middle grades or at the high school level) classroom, using the Hackathon as a venue to share their work

In terms of the content, it would be important to correspond the learning goals for students with big ideas from relevant curricular standards. This step can take place in conjunction with youth activity leaders and area administrators and teachers in [Knox County Schools](https://www.knoxschools.org/).
